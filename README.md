Introduction 
Hello we are the ARM Velocity and we are competing in the category of future engineers. Our team has created an autonomous vehicle that has the capability to detect and avoid obstacles. All the materials we used are from a set called AISTEAM made in China that has all the pieces and components we need for the 1st and 2nd round. The vehicle consists of 2 motors, a control panel, a battery and 4 kinds of sensors and camera. The structure is made of the same set that has the similar pieces to a lego where we can attach and detach pieces easily. The codes that we are using is made by our programmer and is using the AISTEAM software which uses a click and drag type of coding.

	
Mobility Management 
When it comes to the mobility of our vehicle, it only consists of 2 motors, one for steering (rudder motor) and one for moving forward and backward (ordinary motor). These motors are part of the AISTEAM set where the rudder motor or steering gear module has a working voltage of 5V and an angle range of 0-180°. And the ordinary motor module that has a working voltage of 7.4V and a speed of 200RPM±10%.
	

Power and Sense Management 
When it comes to the power, the robot is being powered by a lithium batter module that is included in the AISTEAM set too. The output voltage of this battery is 7.4V with a rated capacity of 1100mAh.
When it comes to its sensors, the robot is using 2 camera or vision module (top and front), infrared barrier avoidance module for sides and integrated greyscale module below which are also part of the AISTEAM set. The two camera or vision module is use for detecting the obstacles and walls, while the barrier avoidance, with a working voltage of 5v and detection range of 5-20cm is responsible of the detection of the sides of the vehicle, while the integrated greyscale is responsible for the detection of blue and orange lines in the playing field. 
The vehicle also has full color light module which is used only as an indication especially for testing/trial run purposes. 


Obstacle Management 
With the obstacles, the vehicle, as I mentioned earlier, is using 2 cameras (top and front) which are responsible for the detection of obstacles. The reason why we use 2 vision modules is because the vehicle has a hard time to process things, especially the detection if it only uses 1 camera. That is why, we distributed the tasks between the two cameras. The top vision is responsible for detecting the walls and the front vision is responsible for detecting the obstacles.
